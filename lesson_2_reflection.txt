What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    Git Bash creates a .git file that contains all the repository and commit
    information, which will be needed for later git log, git checkout and
    other git commands.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area offers flexibility in terms of what files you deem
    necessary to save, giving the user flexibility in this aspect allows for a
    better overview of the workflow and the commits made during the work
    session. See http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/ for commit message
    guidelines. Add a few more lines to test commits.
