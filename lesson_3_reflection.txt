When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    When I need to collaborate with distant colleagues, when I need to
    push commit to the official version of the software, or when I need
    access to the code from another location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you want to be sure that you are pulling changes that are aligned
    with the work that you are doing, and not some feature changes or other
    branches that would mess up your source code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are for collaboration on Github. Users may copy existing code and
    alter it for their own use, but the original creators of the code get credit
    for the parts they wrote.
    Cloning is helpful when you need to copy a repository and to work with it
    locally, when you clone code the original creators does not get credit for
    unless you specifically link to them.
    A branch is often used, to fix bugs or develop features, that are not ready
    ready for the master branch yet (the production code), branches can be
    merged when they are ready to be implemented.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It gives you knowledge of the direction in which the development of the
    production code is going, and you can choose to implement those changes into
    your own code, if you want to.
