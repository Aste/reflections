When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

    When I need to collaborate with distant colleagues, when I need to
    push commit to the official version of the software, or when I need
    access to the code from another location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because you want to be sure that you are pulling changes that are aligned
    with the work that you are doing, and not some feature changes or other
    branches that would mess up your source code.
